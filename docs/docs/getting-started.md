# Getting Started

letmecook creates ephemeral workspaces for AI coding sessions. Instead of pointing your agent at a messy development folder full of outdated code and potential traps, you clone exactly what you need into a clean workspace, do your work, and nuke it when you're done.

The tool is intentionally simple: it sets up repositories and skills, then gets out of your way. You bring whatever coding agent you prefer - if it can open a folder, it works with letmecook.

## Installation

```bash
bun install -g letmecook
```

## Quick Start

1. **Initialize a workspace** in your project directory:

```bash
letmecook init
```

2. **Start a session** to begin working:

```bash
letmecook start
```

3. **Open the TUI** to manage your session interactively:

```bash
letmecook tui
```

## What's Next?

- Learn about [Sessions](/concepts/sessions) and how they work
- Understand [AGENTS.md](/concepts/agents-md) files for AI context
- Explore [Multi-repo Workspaces](/concepts/multi-repo-workspaces)
